                <p>Hi, I'm Junie, and welcome to my personal webpage. This site is a space where I showcase my projects, share my interests, and document what I’m currently learning as I continue to grow my skills in web development. I created this website not only as a way to express myself, but also to challenge myself by building something from scratch and improving my creativity and technical abilities along the way.</p>

                <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my page!!! <br> Feel free to explore, browse through the sections, and learn more about who I am and what I do. I hope you enjoy your visit and discover something inspiring or interesting as you look around.</p>
